# momhub-fullstack

Ive created a fullstack application for moms everywhere its for dads as well I will change the name down the line.

I began by creating a repo, copy the repo into your VSC on your desktop and it helps be connected so 
when you make adds, or any changes to your files you can then push and save it to your githuh repo. 
Once I done that I install the core tools, the stack foundation. 

I've never used Docker before but with the help of Chatgbt I was able to follow the steps and ask 
clarifing questions so I used it correctly. 

Download Docker to your desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
download the correct file for you.

I will be using the following core tools for this project:
Node → run/build the React frontend

Python → run the FastAPI backend

Postgres → store real data

Docker → run Postgres consistently without installing it into macOS
